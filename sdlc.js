// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where the team takes into consideration the more detailed business rules and data modeling and additional considerations"

const design = "This is step three, when the outline of the code is created"

const implementation = "This is step four, when the developers create/code the code"

const testingAndIntegration = "This is step 5, when the new code is debugged and then added into a live enviornment"

const maintain = "This is step six, where the team monitors the code for any needed updates or changes over time"
